I can tell Git to ignore any file or directory by creating a file called:
        .gitignore
For example, files with the extension .pyc are automatically generated from .py files,
so I don't need Git to keep track of them. These files are stored in a directory
called __pycache__. To tell GIt to ignore this directory, in my .gitignore file:
        __pycache__/

Git commands:
    - git init
    - git status
    - git add
    - git commit (flags "-m" to comment and "-a" to add tracked files to commit)
    - git log
    - git checkout

In Git, a "branch" is a version of the porject I'm working on. If I created the
project, I should be in the branch called "master".
